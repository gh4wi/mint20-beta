Installed Mint20 Beta on two PC's, tested ok.
Started Warpinator and discovered neither PC could see the other.
Killed Firewalld daemon & tested net connection /w Firefox, tested ok.
Restared Warpinator w/o Firewalld and found it works ok.
Looks like Warpinator only works with the basic GUFW firewall.
So what needs to be setup in Firewalld to allow Warpinator to work ?
