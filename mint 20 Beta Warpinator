Installed Mint 20 Beta on 2 PC's.
Both PC's work ok, but Warpinator does not see the other computer.
Added 42000 port to Firewalld, but Warpinator not working.
Killed Firewalld Deamon & tested net connection /w Firefox, ok.
Started Warpinator on both PC's and they now see each other.
Transferred files ok.
So, what info should I set in the Firewalld config so that Warpinator will work ?
